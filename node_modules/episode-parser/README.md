A javascript utility for parsing file names in a format that sometimes is used
for tv shows.

It parses a file name like this `Fake.Blood.2013.S07E06.Karma.Sucks.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-STALKERS.srt`
into an object with the following possible properties:

  - `show`, string: The name of the show, `'Fake Blood'`.
  - `year`, integer: The release year, `2013`.
  - `season`, integer: The season number, `7`.
  - `episode`, integer: The episode number, `6`.
  - `episodeCount`, integer: The count of episodes this file name includes, `1`.
  - `name`, string: The name of the episode, `'Karma Sucks'`.
  - `quality`, integer: The quality taken from `720p` or `1080p`. In this case `720`.
  - `source`, string: Available values are `'hdtv'`, `'webdl'`, In this case `'hdtv'`.
  - `codec`, string: Codec used, `'x264'`.
  - `group`, string: Release group, `'STALKERS'`.
  - `ext`, string: File extension, `'srt'`.

## Supported formats

Take a look in [the tests][examples] for examples of what file name formats are
supported.

  [examples]: https://github.com/tregusti/episode-parser/blob/master/test/parser.test.js

## Usage

Simply require the module and you get a parsing function that you invoke with
the file name to parse:

```js
var parser = require('episode-parser')
var filename = 'Fake Blood 2x06 I Need Blood.srt'
var result = parser(filename)
console.log(result.show) //= 'Fake Blood'
console.log(result.year) //= undefined
console.log(result.season) //= 2
console.log(result.codec) //= undefined
```

If the parser can't parse the file name, `null` will be returned. If the parser
can't parse out a specific details, the property for that detail will be missing
from the result.

## Installation

```sh
npm install episode-parser
```

your case. If you feel somewhat lazy, create an issue instead and I might look
into it.
